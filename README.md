# InjectJS
Tool to inject javascript into any website.
## How to download
First, you need to have the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) extension. After that you can use which ever method you'd like.
### Greasyfork
Go to [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/455718-injectjs) and download the script. This should automatically install it and it should be ready.
### Manual
Go to your Tampermonkey dashboard and create a new script. After that copy the code from [main.js](https://github.com/YTXaos/InjectJS/blob/main/main.js). **Do not** remove `@updateURL` and `@downloadURL` unless you want to manually update this script.
